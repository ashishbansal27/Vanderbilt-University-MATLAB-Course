# Vanderbilt-University-MATLAB-Course
Contains homework from MATLAB Course on Coursera

I took a MATLAB programming course on Coursera which was offered by Vanderbilt Univeristy and this repository contains the homework assignments.
The (dot)p files which are are present in the repository are the automatic evaluation scripts written by university to check my assignments and grade them. 
The rest of the files are the solutions to the questions. 
The questions are available in a PDF file which is also present in each week's assignment folder.
